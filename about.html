            <p id="p3">Hi, I'm Michael. If it wasn't obvious enough I am a Philly sports fan. During my free time I like
                to play video games with my friends. Video games I play include Minecraft, sometimes Roblox, and other
                games we find on Steam. I also make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/poglinxd">Minecraft YouTube
                    videos</a> and I'm almost at 5,000 subscribers. I also like to watch Phillies baseball games with my
                parents. At school, I have
                above average grades and I plan on going to college for a computer related degree (I don't know which
                one yet).</p>

            <p id="p4">I'm not that interesting of a person, and there really isn't much else to say about me (Other
                than how much I hate the Dallas Cowboys. I could go on a rant for an hour about how they will never win
                a Super Bowl).</p>
