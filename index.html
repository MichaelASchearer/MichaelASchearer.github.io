            <p id="p1">Welcome to my website! If you don't know who I am, I recommend to view the About Me page using
                the link at the top of this page. This website is sort of a portfolio from what I have learned in HTML and CSS
                throughout the 4th quarter this year. Here you will also find my game that I made earlier in the 4th quarter.
                I hope you can
                enjoy reading my website!</p>
